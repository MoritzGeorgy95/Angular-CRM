<h2>The idea behind toolio</h2>
<p>When administering my clients I was missing a concise overview over my client data. Hence I started looking into existing CRM systems but could not find one that fit my needs. So I came up with the idea to build one on my own. So I came up with Toolio which is customized to my personal needs.
