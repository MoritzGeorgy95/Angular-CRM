<h1>Toolio CRM</h1>

Toolio CRM is a lightweight Customer Relation Management Tool that I developed for my own usage which helps with administering client data. It was built using Angular/ Firebase and Material Design. This repo contains all the source code which is strucured by components. 

Toolio CRM is split into three parts:

<ol>
 <li> A dashboard that displays several metrics such as the current weather, upcoming meetings/ events scheduled with clients and a calendar.</li>
 <li> A clients page where all currently existing client accounts are displayed & clients can be filtered by several different criteria.</li>
  <li> A client detail page where all the data of an individual client is getting displayed. This data of course can be edited. Also, users can upload documents and create projects for the respective cient.</li>


<h1>Feel free to live test the project on: https://crm-system-f7e71.web.app/</h1>
